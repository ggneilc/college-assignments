Assignments done in college that were noteworthy in either practically or rigourous solutions. 

## My Style

I use obsidian to take my notes and build my 'Second Brain' of information, since obsidian uses markdown & latex formatting, I have accumulated a solid set of skills and eye for creating pleasing work. I am actually at the point where I can do almost everything while inside of obsidian, therefore even things like my homework assignments gets an extra layer of formallity to it that is quick & easy for me to replicate. I am at the point where I can type complicated math equations in latex faster than I could write them by hand, and markdown formatting comes naturally to me. 

If you think I am overhyping anything, please look at my homework assignments within this repo, and then also check out [this article]([https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/])https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) to see where I drew my inspiration from.
